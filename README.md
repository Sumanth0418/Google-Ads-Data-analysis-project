# Google-Ads-Data-analysis-project

This dataset is taken from the kaggle Google Ads Dataset
 
Quick note on the dataset: 
- 'cost' is our total ad spends for that particular date.
- 'Impressions' are the count of people who view our ad
- 'clicks' are count of clicks on our ad
-  'prospects' are count of people interested in our product (as marked by sales)
- 'Payments' are purchases made. Returns on Ad spends are calculated using Payments/Cost.
- Each row is cohortised to the date of ad spends so you can compare quality of ad spends.

# Google-Ads-Data-analysis-project


For this project, we utilized Google Ads Data. With this Data, I was able to calculate weekly and monthly total spends and returns, determine the most profitable channel by campaign and ads group, identify profit by keyword, create a time series graph, and analyze total spending by country for both sets of data. I visualized this information and generated a dashboard in Excel.

This dataset is taken from the Kaggle Google Ads Dataset
 
A quick note on the dataset: 
- 'cost' is our total ad spend for that particular date.
- 'Impressions' are the count of people who view our ad
- 'Clicks' are the count of clicks on our ad
-  'prospects' are a count of people interested in our product (as marked by sales)
- 'Payments' are purchases made. Returns on Ad spends are calculated using Payments/Cost.
- Each row is cohorts to the date of ad spending so you can compare quality of ad spends.

Requirements
- Create a combined report with all key metrics (esp: Spends and Returns %) in a weekly and monthly format. Decide the number of data fields you would like to showcase here.
- Which is the most profitable channel
- Which category/keyword is the most profitable
- Look for insights by analyzing data points on time series graphs
- Analyse the Impact of geography
